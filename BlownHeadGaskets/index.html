          <h3 class="header-background">The New Tesla Plaid</h3>
          <p>
            Tesla's 2022 Model S Plaid can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in less
            than 2 seconds, a new milestone for the industry. Now you might be
            asking "Who the hell would need that?" Good question, but to put it
            simply everyone needs it. Everyone needs to experience this speed at
            least once in their life, not just Han Solo. When you hear 1,020
            horsepower you usually picture turbo's and supercharger's ramming
            engines with air, but with this car it couldnt be further from that.
            As much as I admire the sound of engines with thousands of moving
            parts, the Tesla is an incredible feat. With low center of gravity,
            instant torque, and capable steering this car feels more grounded
            than any car i've ever driven.

          <h3 class="header-background">A Look Back On The BMW E30 M3</h3>
          <p>
           The year is 1985, sports cars are on the rise again, and BMW is looking for a new car to compete in the races.
           With the success of the M5 BMW saw a new market in souped up daily vehicles. Thus spawned the E30 M3, possibly one of the best production M cars.
           With heavier sport suspension, a beefier engine, and wider fenders this car was no regular 318i.
           The M3 started a new generation of automobiles, alongside the Mercedes E190 Evolution 2.
           Soon after companies started to see the market and followed suit. Subaru produced the 22B, Toyota followed through with the redesigned MR2, and Mistubishi with the Evolution series.
           BMW single handedly started a new generation in consumer rally vehicles, and thats why The E30 M3 is really something to look back on.
           With prices rising in the hundreds of thousands as the car gets older, it sure is a treat to see one in the wild.

          <h3 class="header-background">Nissan's Last Chance On the Z-Car</h3>
          <p>
           It's 2021 and the popularity of the Sport Car has taken a toll. With many car manufacturers switching to compact's and SUV's
           Sports cars just aren't as practical anymore. But every year Nissan persists sports cars should still have a home. The Z series
           has been more than faithful over the years. The 350Z was a great coup with decent power for the time, and the 370Z was a much
           needed upgrade. In 2022 Nissan plans to release the "400Z" at a price of $40,000 USD. This car will have a Twin-Turbo V-6 engine,
           which many think will produce around 400 horsepower, Outstanding numbers for the price. This car looks amazing as a homage to the
           Z-Car's ancestors. Is this thing going to take the Supra to gapple bee's? Maybe, we'll just have to wait and see.
